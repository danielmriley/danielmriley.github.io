I am a Ph.D. student at [Florida State University](www.fsu.edu) studying Formal Methods in
the [Computer Science Department](www.cs.fsu.edu) under the guidance of Dr. [Grigory Fedyukovich](http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~grigory/). I began the program in January of 2020.

Our society relies heavily on the use of software. It is in the devices we use every day, in our vehicles, infrastructure, etc. We expect those systems to function properly with as few problems as possible. As software becomes more complex error checking becomes more difficult. My research will focus on improving software safety by proving its safety through the efficient synthesis of inductive invariants.
